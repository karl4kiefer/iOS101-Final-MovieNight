# iOS101-Final-MovieNight
The final project for CodePath's iOS101 class. MovieNight is an app that takes data from The Movie Database (TMDb) to give the user movie suggestions from their selected genres. They can change their prefered genres, along with save movies for later. There is also a suggest a random movie button, which does exactly as it sounds.
